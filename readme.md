## Introduction

In this project we will develop a classifier to seperate waste into six classes : glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and trash based on their images.   
As a result of rapid urbanization and population growth, the amount of waste produced each year in the world is expected to rise to 3.4 billion tons over the next three decades, up from 2.01 billion tons in 2016, according to the World Bank.   
What a Waste 2.0 report underlines the crucial importance of household waste management for sustainable, healthy and inclusive urban development, and highlights the fact that this sector is often neglected, particularly in low-income countries.
This project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in waste management and in autoamtic sorting systems helping ciruclar economies to better design product reuse and recycling.  


Automatically classifying the types of waste would effectively : 
- be an aid to the domestic sorting of waste
- allow for a verification system at the time of waste collection
- be integrated into sorting machines in recycling plants 
- Reduce toxic waste ending in landfills

### Dataset

The data comes from the dataset [trashnet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) for a final project of [Stanford's CS 229: Machine Learning class](http://cs229.stanford.edu)
the dataset consists of 2527 images:
- 501 glass
- 594 paper
- 403 cardboard
- 482 plastic
- 410 metal
- 137 trash

The pictures were taken by placing the object on a white posterboard and using sunlight and/or room lighting. The pictures have been resized down to 512 x 384, which can be changed in `data/constants.py` (resizing them involves going through step 1 in usage). The devices used were Apple iPhone 7 Plus, Apple iPhone 5S, and Apple iPhone SE.
You can find the dataset used in the /dataset folder inside the notebook folder. 

### Pytorch Learning
You will find our notebook used to train our model in /notebook folder and its html generated file. You can open it locally our use colab to use GPU instance provided by Google.

1st neural network
Resnet50 pre-train
First, we will train a model based on Densenet121, using Federated learning approach. Specifically, we will create two (virtual) workers, `hospital_1` and `hospital_2`, where Histopathological images will be sent for training. Then the results from each worker is combined to build a privacy preserving classifier. Check the [notebook](https://github.com/avinassh/breast-cancer-prediction/blob/master/Detecting_Breast_Cancer_With_Federated_Learning.ipynb) for more details on training.

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images.
